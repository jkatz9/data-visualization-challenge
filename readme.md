# Data Visualization Challenge

This project involves analyzing and visualizing data from a pharmaceutical study. The goal is to generate various plots and statistical analyses to understand the effects of different drug regimens on tumor volume in mice.

## Project Structure

- `pymaceuticals_starter.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the code for data analysis and visualization.
- `data/`: Directory containing the dataset used in the study.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scipy

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jkatz9/data-visualization-challenge.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd data-visualization-challenge
   ```
3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook pymaceuticals_starter.ipynb
   ```
2. Run the cells in the notebook to perform data analysis and generate visualizations.

## Analysis

The analysis includes the following steps:

1. **Data Cleaning**: Identifying and removing duplicate entries.
2. **Summary Statistics**: Calculating mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of tumor volume for each drug regimen.
3. **Box Plots**: Visualizing the distribution of tumor volume for each treatment group.
4. **Line Plot**: Plotting tumor volume vs. time point for a single mouse treated with Capomulin.
5. **Scatter Plot**: Plotting mouse weight vs. average observed tumor volume for the Capomulin regimen.
6. **Correlation and Regression**: Calculating the correlation coefficient and linear regression model for mouse weight and average tumor volume.

## Results

The results of the analysis provide insights into the effectiveness of different drug regimens in reducing tumor volume in mice. The visualizations help in understanding the distribution and trends in the data.
